# Codex — WYSIWYG for Developers

**Codex is an in-development WYSIWYG editor _for the developer community_.**

Historically, the developer community has had a distaste for WYSIWYG editors.

Namely, there are three reasons:
- WYSIWYG editor’s don’t understand markdown
- WYSIWYG editor’s don’t support export to markdown or HTML
- _WYSIWYG editors just don’t understand developers_ 😭

**Codex is purpose-built to solve these problems and more.** 🌈

## Wait — Why WYSIWYG?

Don’t get me wrong, [markdown editors are pretty cool and all](https://editor-v2-arch.netlify.app) but lack the ability to control their own destiny. By which I mean, all design decisions *must* prioritize markdown, even at the expense of the editing experience.

> _So what if we had a WYSIWYG editor that uniquely understood the needs of the developer community?_ 🤔

🥁 Enter Codex! 🥁

## With Codex, you’ll be able to:

🙌 &nbsp;**Author on the web in a well-behaved WYSIWYG editor**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test<br>
🧠 &nbsp;**Use markdown syntax as shortcuts for WYSIWYG formatting**<br>
👾 &nbsp;**Author inline code and code blocks with dynamic syntax highlighting**<br>
✂️ &nbsp;**Cut, copy, and paste as markdown**<br>
👩‍💻 &nbsp;**Render to GitHub Flavored Markdown and semantic HTML in realtime**<br>
🧐 &nbsp;**Customize the editor’s aesthetic to your needs**<br>
🤪 &nbsp;**_Forget markdown syntax_**<br>
✨ &nbsp;**More!**

## Current Status

The Codex editor is currently in <u>alpha</u> status.

Here’s what’s currently missing from the MVP features:

- [ ] Support for pending formatting ranges (e.g. formatting without a selection)
- [ ] Support for multiline elements; `<blockquote>`, `<ul>`, etc.
- [ ] Support for media elements; `<img>`, etc.
- [ ] Support for markdown-to-WYSIWYG transformations
- [ ] Support for clipboard operations (cut, copy, paste)
- [ ] Support for history operations (undo, redo)

## In-Progress Demo

The current alpha is hosted on Netlify at [codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app](https://codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app). Have at it!
