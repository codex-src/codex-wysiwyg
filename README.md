# Codex â€” WYSIWYG for Developers

**Codex is an in-development WYSIWYG editor _for the developer community_.**

Historically, the developer community has had a distaste for WYSIWYG editors. Namely, there are two reasons: WYSIWYG editorâ€™s donâ€™t understand markdown, and WYSIWYG editorâ€™s donâ€™t copy-paste to markdown.

Codex is purpose-built to solve these problems and more!

Donâ€™t get me wrong, [markdown editors are pretty cool and all](https://editor-v2-arch.netlify.app) but lack the ability to control their own destiny. By which I mean, all design decisions *must* prioritze markdown, even at the cost of the editor itself. And this is a problem if youâ€™re trying to sincerely improve peopleâ€™s lives, because at the end of the day I donâ€™t think most of us _want_ to write code, we simply _need_ to write code to express ourselves.

The current alpha is hosted on Netlify at [codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app](https://codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app). Have at it!
