# Codex — WYSIWYG for Developers 🦕

**Codex is an in-development WYSIWYG editor _for the developer community_.**

Historically, the developer community has had a distaste for WYSIWYG editors.

Namely, there are three reasons:
- WYSIWYG editor’s don’t understand markdown
- WYSIWYG editor’s don’t support export to markdown or HTML
- _WYSIWYG editors just don’t understand developers_ 😭

**Codex is purpose-built to solve these problems and more.** 🌈

## In-Progress Demo

The current alpha is hosted on Netlify at [codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app](https://codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app). Have at it!

Feedback about _all aspects_ of Codex are welcome. Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/codex-src/codex-wysiwyg/issues/new) or DM me on Twitter [@username_ZAYDEK](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=899350210064687105).

## Wait — Why WYSIWYG?

Don’t get me wrong, [markdown editors are pretty cool and all](https://editor-v2-arch.netlify.app) but lack the ability to control their own destiny. By which I mean, all design decisions *must* prioritize markdown, even at the expense of the editing experience.

> _So what if we had a WYSIWYG editor that uniquely understood the needs of the developer community?_ 🤔

🥁 Enter Codex! 🥁

## With Codex, you’ll be able to:

- **Author on the web in a well-behaved WYSIWYG editor.** ✍️<br>
	All modern desktop browsers will be supported, including iOS.
- **Use markdown syntax as shortcuts for WYSIWYG formatting.** 🧠⚡️<br>
	For example, `**bold**` → `<strong>bold</strong>`.
- **Author inline code and code blocks with dynamic syntax highlighting.** 🌈<br>
	You, dear developer, are a respected member of society.
- **Cut, copy, and paste as markdown.** ✂️<br>
	_Never_ loose the semantic meaning of your documents. This also means your documents will be interoperable with Notion!.
- **Render to GitHub Flavored Markdown and semantic HTML in realtime.** 👩‍💻👨‍💻<br>
	Bootstrap your next project by using Codex to generate your content.
- **Customize the editor’s aesthetic to your needs.** 🧐<br>
