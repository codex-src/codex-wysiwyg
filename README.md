# Codex — WYSIWYG for Developers

**Codex is an in-development WYSIWYG editor _for the developer community_.**

Historically, the developer community has had a distaste for WYSIWYG editors.

Namely, there are three reasons:
- WYSIWYG editor’s don’t understand markdown
- WYSIWYG editor’s don’t support export to markdown or HTML
- _WYSIWYG editors just don’t understand developers_ 😡

**Codex is purpose-built to solve these problems and more.** 🌈

### Wait — Why WYSIWYG?

Don’t get me wrong, [markdown editors are pretty cool and all](https://editor-v2-arch.netlify.app) but lack the ability to control their own destiny. By which I mean, all design decisions *must* prioritize markdown, even at the expense of the editing experience.

_So what if we had a WYSIWYG editor that uniquely understood the needs of the developer community?_ 🤔

<br>
### With Codex, you’ll be able to:

* Author on the web in a well-behaved WYSIWYG editor
* Use markdown syntax as shortcuts for WYSIWYG formatting
* Author inline code and code blocks with dynamic syntax highlighting
* Cut, copy, and paste as markdown
* Render to GitHub Flavored Markdown and semantic HTML in realtime
* Customize the editor’s aesthetic to your needs
* _Forget markdown syntax_ 😅
* More ✨

### Current Status

The Codex editor is currently in <u>alpha</u> status.

Here’s what’s currently missing from the MVP features:

- [ ] Support for pending formatting ranges (e.g. formatting without a selection)
- [ ] Support for multiline elements; `<blockquote>`, `<ul>`, etc.
- [ ] Support for media elements; `<img>`, etc.
- [ ] Support for markdown-to-WYSIWYG transformations
- [ ] Support for clipboard operations (cut, copy, paste)
- [ ] Support for history operations (undo, redo)

### In-Progress Demo

The current alpha is hosted on Netlify at [codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app](https://codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app). Have at it!
