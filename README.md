# Codex â€” WYSIWYG for Developers

**Codex is an in-development WYSIWYG editor _for the developer community_.**

Historically, developers have a distaste for WYSIWYG editors for two reasons: WYSIWYG editorâ€™s donâ€™t understand markdown and WYSIWYG editorâ€™s donâ€™t export to markdown. Codex is purpose-built to solve these problems.

[Markdown editors are pretty cool and all](https://editor-v2-arch.netlify.app) but lack the ability to control their own destiny. By which I mean, all decisions _must_ prioritize markdown. This can become a problem later on.

The current alpha is hosted on Netlify at [codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app](https://codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app). Have at it!
