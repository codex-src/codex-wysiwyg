# Codex 🦕

**Codex is an in-development (status: alpha) WYSIWYG editor for the developer community.**

The purpose of Codex is to make note-taking, publishing to the web, and new forms of self-expression accessible to the developer community.

The current alpha is hosted on Netlify at [codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app](https://codex-wysiwyg.netlify.app).

## Wait — Why WYSIWYG?

Historically, the developer community has had a distaste for WYSIWYG editors. 🤢

Namely, there are three reasons:

- WYSIWYG editors don’t understand markdown.
- WYSIWYG editors don’t support export to markdown or HTML.
- _WYSIWYG editors just don’t understand developers._ 😭

**Codex is purpose-built to solve these problems and more.** 🌈

Don’t get me wrong, [markdown editors are pretty cool](https://editor-v2-arch.netlify.app) but lack the ability to control their own destiny. By which I mean, all design decisions *must* prioritize markdown, even at the expense of the editing experience.

_So what if we had a WYSIWYG editor that uniquely understood the needs of the developer community?_ 🤔

-->

## With Codex, you’ll be able to:

- **Author on the web in a well-behaved WYSIWYG editor.** ✍️<br>
	All modern desktop browsers will be supported, including iOS.
- **Use markdown syntax as shortcuts for WYSIWYG formatting.** 🧠⚡️<br>
	For example, `**bold**` → `<strong>bold</strong>`.
- **Author inline code and code blocks with dynamic syntax highlighting.** 🌈<br>
	You, dear developer, are a respected member of society.
- **Cut, copy, and paste as markdown.** ✂️<br>
	_Never_ lose the semantic meaning of your documents. This also means your documents will be interoperable with Notion!
- **Render to GitHub Flavored Markdown and semantic HTML in realtime.** 👩‍💻👨‍💻<br>
	Bootstrap your next project by using Codex to generate your content.
- **Customize the editor’s aesthetic to your needs.** 🧐<br>
	Light mode, dark mode, and support for colorful themes.
- **Auto-generate table-of-contents.** 🔗<br>
	Codex generates document-unique links for every header element and generates a table-of-contents for you, for every document.
- **_Forget markdown syntax?!_** 🤪<br>
	_Is he serious??_
- **More!** ✨
